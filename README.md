# R_energy_data_analysis
 A task for the course R language. This is a part of our group project. The codes in this repository are what I have done. 
 Please download the `Energy_analysis_index_system.html` file and open it with your brower to see the results. 
 Briefly, we use R language as a tool to analysis energy performance of four states in the United States. The topic comes from MCM/ICM 2018 problem C. Other of my group members did the statistical analysis, descriptive analysis and some forecasting jobs. What I did is to establish an Energy Performance Index using R to measure the performance of each state within a single year and see the evolution. We also can do the comparisons among different states. The raw data can be accessed on the website of U.S Energy Information Administration: [eia](https://www.eia.gov/).
